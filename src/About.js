            <p>The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular 
                automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway 
                in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution 
                is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. 
                One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration 
                and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a 
                universal constructor or any other Turing machine.</p>
